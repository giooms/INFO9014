<span class="markdown">
The TimeRep ontology provides a conceptual model for time tracking and project management, particularly aimed at freelancers and small businesses who need to track their work activities, manage client relationships, and facilitate accurate billing.

## Core Classes and Structure

### Agent Framework
The ontology is built around the concept of **Agents** as the primary actors in the system. Agents are divided into:

- **Person**: Human actors in the system
    - **User**: The primary user of the TimeRep system who manages projects and tracks time
- **Organization**: Entities that commission projects and have contacts

### Project Organization
Projects form the organizational backbone of the TimeRep system:

- **Project**: A defined body of work commissioned by an Organization
- **Task**: Specific activities performed within projects, always assigned to exactly one Project

### Time Tracking
Time tracking is implemented through a temporal framework:

- **TemporalEntity**: Abstract class for entities with time dimensions
    - **Report**: Records of time spent on particular tasks, always reported by a User
    - **Contract**: Formal agreements that cover Projects and specify work arrangements and rates

### Supporting Concepts
Additional concepts support the core functionality:

- **Expense**: Records costs incurred during project execution, always linked to a Report
- **Location**: Places where work is performed, associated with Reports
- **ValidationStatus**: Represents the validation state of entities based on SHACL constraints

## Key Relationships

The ontology defines clear semantic relationships between concepts, including:

- Users define tasks, establish contracts with organizations, and log reports
- Projects belong to organizations (exactly one) and are covered by contracts
- Tasks are assigned to exactly one project and defined by users
- Reports are reported by users, for specific tasks, and at specific locations
- Organizations have contacts (Person) and projects
- Reports can include expenses and can be billable

## Validation Framework

A key feature of the TimeRep ontology is its built-in validation framework, which:

- Links entities to their validation statuses through hasValidationStatus property
- Records validation results, messages, and counts of errors/warnings
- Supports validation timestamps to track when validations occurred
- Links to the SHACL constraints defined in the companion shapes graph

This semantic structure enables faithful time tracking, project management, and reporting capabilities while maintaining data integrity through validation.
