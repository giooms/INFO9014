<span class="markdown">The TimeRep Ontology is a semantic model designed to represent and standardize the concepts and relationships involved in time tracking and project management for freelancers and small businesses. Time tracking is essential for service providers who bill by the hour or need to monitor project efficiency. Yet few existing systems enable semantic interoperability and validation capabilities. This ontology addresses these challenges by providing a conceptual framework that defines key entities listed below. The primary goals of TimeRep are to: (1) provide a standardized vocabulary for time tracking concepts, (2) enable semantic validation of time tracking data, (3) support interoperability between different time management systems, (4) facilitate accurate reporting and billing for client work, and (5) create a foundation for time management applications.</span>
