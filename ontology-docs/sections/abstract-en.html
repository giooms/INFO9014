<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The TimeRep Ontology provides a semantic model for time tracking and project management, mainly targetted for freelancers and small businesses. It defines core concepts such as Organization, Project, Task, Contract, Report, Expense, Location, and User, along with their interrelationships. The ontology enables users to organize work, manage client relationships, assign and track tasks, log time and expenses, and generate reports for invoicing. By formalizing these concepts and their constraints, TimeRep supports interoperability between time tracking systems and semantic validation of data using SHACL constraints, ensuring data quality and consistency.
